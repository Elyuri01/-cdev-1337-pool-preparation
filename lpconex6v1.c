/* You've learned and implemented several key programming concepts:

Prime number logic - understanding what makes a number prime
Square root optimization - only checking up to âˆšn for efficiency
Flag variables - using boolean-like variables to track state
Loop control - using while loops effectively
Conditional logic - making decisions based on conditions
Input/output - getting user input and displaying results */
