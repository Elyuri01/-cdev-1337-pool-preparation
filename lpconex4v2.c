/* Breakdown of the Code

Variable Declarations:

int i; declares a variable to store the user input.
int factorial = 1; initializes the variable to hold the result of the factorial calculation.

User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
The if (scanf("%d", &i) != 1) checks if the input is valid. If the input is not a valid integer, it prints an error 
message and exits.

Input Validation:

else if (i < 0) checks if the number is negative and displays an error message if it is.
else if (i > 12) checks if the number is greater than 12 and warns the user about potential overflow.

While Loop:

The loop while (i >= 1) calculates the factorial by multiplying the current value of i with factorial and decrementing i in each iteration.

Output:

Finally, printf("The factorial of your number is : %d\n", factorial); prints the result.

Expected Output
Your program should work as expected. Hereâ€™s what the output would look like for different inputs:

If the user enters 5:
The factorial of your number is : 120

If the user enters -3:
Error! Please enter a positive integer

If the user enters 15:
Warning! The factorial of your number is too big.
Enter a number no greater than 12 */
